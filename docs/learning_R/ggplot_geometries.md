Depending on the geom function that are added to the plot, different aesthetics are needed. 

Which aesthetics are required for a plot depend on which geoms (more on those in a second) you’re adding to the plot. You can find out the aesthetics you can use for a geom in the “Aesthetics” section of the geom’s help file (e.g., ?geom_point). Required aesthetics are in bold in this section of the help file and optional ones are not.
