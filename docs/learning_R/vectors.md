# Vectors

A vector is defined as a place to hold a sequence of elements of the same data type.
It is one of the data structures used in R programming. 
There are two fundamental one dimensional data structures holding multiple elements: 

- Atomic vectors
- Lists

:::note


The elements inside an atomic vector **must** be of the same data type and separated by a comma!
If you create a vector with different data types, all non-character values will be coerced into a character type element, if one of them is character.

Lists, on the other hand, can contain elements of different data types. 

:::

To create an atomic vector, use the `c()` function:

```r
# In the following vector the names of 10 students in a classroom are stored
names_class <- c("Pia", "Mia", "Tia", "Kevin", "Rock", "Sam", "Richard", "Sara", "Tim")
```
Just like variables, you can simply type out the name of the vector, to display its contents. For the above example, the output would be:

```r
> names_class
[1] "Pia"     "Mia"     "Tia"     "Kevin"  
[5] "Rock"    "Sam"     "Richard" "Sara"   
[9] "Tim"   
```

## Selecting elements from vectors

### Method 1: Specify an Index
You can choose specific elements from a vector through vector indexing. To do this, use square brackets (e.g. vector[1]) after the vector name and type in the index number that represents the position of the element inside the vector.

:::info Index in R

Each element inside a vector has an index:

```r
Vector: c("A",	"B",	"C",	"D")
Index:		1	 2		 3		 4
```
Note that the first element in a vector has index 1, not 0 as in many other programming languages, like Python.

:::

:::note example

```r
# In the following vector the names of 10 students in a classroom are stored
names_class <- c("Pia", "Mia", "Tia", "Kevin", "Rock", "Sam", "Richard", "Sara", "Tim")

# Selecting the third element inside this vector using vector indexing
names_class[3]
```
The above code would yield the following output:

```r
> names_class[3]
[1] "Tia"
```
:::

:::tip

Vector indexing is especially useful when you want to change an element from a specific vector. You can simply refer to the location of the current element using the index number and then assign a new element:

```r
# change the first name of names_class to Ria
names_class[1] <- "Ria"
```
This will change the first element of `names_class` from "Pia" to "Ria":

```r
> names_class
[1] "Ria"     "Mia"     "Tia"     "Kevin"  
[5] "Rock"    "Sam"     "Richard" "Sara"   
[9] "Tim"  
```

:::

You can also select multiple elements from a vector, using `:` or `c(,)`. 

```r
# Selecting the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh element from the names_class vector:
names_class[3:7]
names_class[c(3, 4, 5, 6, 7)]
```
Both lines would give the following output:

```r
[1] "Tia"     "Kevin"   "Rock"    "Sam"    
[5] "Richard"
```

:::note
The colon operator (`a:b`) allows you to select all the elements from the first specified index (a) to the last specified index (b).
If you use a vector as an index you can explicitly speficy the desired elements.
:::

:::info

You can also access elements through the use of negative indexing. By giving a negative value in the index, R will drop that element from the result:

```r
names_class <- c("Pia", "Mia", "Tia", "Kevin", "Rock", "Sam", "Richard", "Sara", "Tim")

# Select all elements from the vector, except the second element
names_class[c(-2)]
```
R will omit the element at index 2 in its output:


```r
[1] "Pia"     "Tia"     "Kevin"   "Rock"   
[5] "Sam"     "Richard" "Sara"    "Tim"   
```


:::

### Method 2: Specify the names

 Rather than using indices, you can also select elements by their names.
 For this, you need to name each individual element inside a vector using the `names()` function:

 ```r
# Creating a vector that stores the pulse rate of a patient that was measured consecutively every day for a week
pulse_rate <- c(78, 68, 74, 59, 64, 61, 57)

# to have a clear view of the data, name the above elements after the weekday on which they were measured
names(pulse_rate) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")

# print out the pulse_rate vector
pulse_rate
```

The output to the above code would be:

```r
Monday   Tuesday Wednesday  Thursday 
   78        68        74        59 
Friday  Saturday    Sunday 
   64        61        57 
```

Now, to select an element from the `pulse_rate` vector, use the designated name:

```r
# Select the pulse rate that was measured on Thursday
pulse_rate["Thursday"]
```

The output will be the element that corresponds to the name `"Thursday"`:

```r
Thursday 
    59 
```

Similar to the first method, you can also select multiple elements using their names:

```r
# Select the pulse rate that was measured on Monday, Tuesday and Friday

pulse_rate[c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Friday")]

```
The output will be the elements that correspond to the names "Monday", "Tuesday", "Friday":

```r
Monday Tuesday  Friday 
 78      68      64 
```

:::caution

When using names to select elements from a vector, you cannot use the colon operator (`:`) to select multiple elements!

:::


### Method 3: Specify a Logical Vector
This method requires the use of a logical operator which was introduced before. 

At first, you need to define a logical argument:

```r
# Write a command that will print out all elements in pulse_rate that are above 65
pulse_rate <- c(78, 68, 74, 59, 64, 61, 57)
logical_pulse_rate <- pulse_rate > 65
logical_pulse_rate
```
The above code tests if the condition stated by the logical operator is `TRUE` or `FALSE` for every element inside `pulse_rate`: 

```r
[1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
```

You can select the elements that correspond to `TRUE` in `pulse_rate` by using the logical vector as an index for the `pulse_rate` vector:

```r
# Show the pulse rate that were above 65 bpm
pulse_rate[logical_pulse_rate]
```

R will automatically only show the elements that correspond to `TRUE` in `logical_pulse_rate`:


```r
[1] 78 68 74
```

:::tip

To make the data even clearer, you can name the elements inside `pulse_rate` as seen in Method 2.
That way you will also see on which day the pulse rate was above 65 bpm:

```r
pulse_rate <- c(78, 68, 74, 59, 64, 61, 57)
names(pulse_rate) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")
logical_pulse_rate <- pulse_rate > 65
pulse_rate[logical_pulse_rate]
```
The output will be:

```r
Monday   Tuesday Wednesday 
   78        68        74 
```

This gives a much better overview, right? ðŸ˜‰

## Working with vectors

### Merging different vectors together

You can not only use `c()` to create a new vector, but you can also use it to merge existing vectors into one:

```r
# create vector that that stores patient A's temperature over a week
temperature_week1 <- c(36, 35.9, 36.6, 36.2, 36.0, 37.1, 36.9)

# create another vector that stores patient A's temperature over a week 
temperature_week2 <- c(36.4, 36.9, 35.6, 37.2, 36.7, 35.3, 36.2)

# merge the above vectors together
temperature_overall <- c(temperature_week1, temperature_week2)
temperature_overall 
```
The output of `temperature_overall` is:

```r
[1] 36.0 35.9 36.6 36.2 36.0 37.1 36.9 36.4 36.9
[10] 35.6 37.2 36.7 35.3 36.2
```

### Arithmetic operations

You can perform any arithmetic operation on vectors by using the arithmetic operators that were introduced a few chapters earlier.
Note that R works element-wise, e.g. when adding two vectors, the first element in each vector is added together, then the second element in each vector is added together and so on:

```r
vector_1 <- c(3, 3, 3)
vector_2 <- c(1, 2, 3)

# Take the sum of vector_1 and vector_2
sum_vector <- vector_1  + vector_2

# Subtract vector_2 from vector_1
subtract_vector <- vector_1  - vector_2

# divide vector_1 with vector_2
divide_vector <- vector_1  / vector_2
```
This will give the following output:

```r
> sum_vector
[1] 4 5 6
> subtract_vector
[1] 2 1 0
> divide_vector
[1] 3.0 1.5 1.0
```

### The `sum()` function

You can calculate the sum of all elements in a vector (given that the elements are all numbers of some kind) using the sum() function:

```r
number_of_erythrocytes <- c(54, 23, 46, 62, 43, 59, 57, 50, 62)

# calculate the sum of the values in the vector (Neubauer ZÃ¤hlkammer)
total_erythrocytes <- sum(number_of_erythrocytes)
```
R will output the sum of the elements in vector `number_of_cells`

```r
[1] 456
```

### Relational operations

You can also compare the values of different vectors by using the relational operators `< ` and` >`:

```r
number_of_leukocytes <- c(12, 28, 8, 18, 21, 19, 27, 12, 20)
total_leukocytes <- sum(number_of_leukocytes)

# compare total_leukocytes with total_erythrocytes
total_erythrocytes < total_leukocytes
```
The output will be:

```r
[1] FALSE
```

### The `mean()` function

To calculate the average of values of a vector, you can use the mean() function:

```r
number_of_leukocytes <- c(12, 28, 8, 18, 21, 19, 27, 12, 20)

# calculate the average number of leukocytes
mean(number_of_leukocytes)
```

The output will be:

```r
[1] 18.33333
```

### The `seq()` function

We can also create a vector with numerical values in a sequence. To do so, we require the `seq()` function as well as three parameters:
- ` from ` = number at which the sequence begins
- ` to` = number at which the sequence ends
- ` by ` = interval of the sequence

```r
# create a vector with a numerical sequence that begins at 0 and ends at 50 and goes up in intervals of 10
numbers <- seq(from = 0, to = 50, by = 10)
```
The output will be:

```r
[1]  0 10 20 30 40 50
```

:::tip

You can also write the above line of code in a shorter form (see chapter functions):

```r
numbers <- seq(0, 50, 10)
```

:::

### The `sort()` function

You can sort the elements in a vector using the `sort()` function in alphabetical order or (if it is numerical) from the smallest to the largest element:

```r
numbers_1 <- c(2,218,-64, 5.2,0,441, -19, 329)
names_class <- c("Pia", "Mia", "Tia", "Kevin", "Rock", "Sam", "Richard", "Sara", "Tim")

# Sort the elements of numbers_1 in order of the smallest to the largest
numbers_1_sorted <- sort(numbers_1)

# Sort the elements of names_class in alphabetical order
names_class_sorted <- sort(names_class)

numbers_1_sorted
names_class_sorted
```
The output will show the following:

```r
[1] "Kevin"   "Mia"     "Pia"     "Richard"
[5] "Rock"    "Sam"     "Sara"    "Tia"    
[9] "Tim" 
```

:::tip

To sort the elements in reverse order, use the additional parameter `decreasing = TRUE`. This can be used for both numerical and character vectors!
