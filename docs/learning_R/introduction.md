# Introduction: Learning the Basics of R

## What is R?

R is a free, open-source programming language and environment designed for statistical computing and graphics. Originally created in 1995, R has grown into one of the most widely used languages in data science, biostatistics, and scientific research worldwide.

### Why Learn R?

In the context of cancer informatics, R offers several critical advantages:

- **Statistical Power**: Built from the ground up for statistical analysis, making it ideal for analyzing clinical trial data and cancer research datasets
- **Visualization**: Create publication-quality figures and interactive visualizations essential for communicating research findings
- **Reproducibility**: Write scripts that document your entire analysis workflow, ensuring results can be verified and reproduced
- **Community and Resources**: Vast ecosystem of packages (over 20,000) created by researchers, including specialized bioinformatics tools
- **Integration with Other Tools**: Works seamlessly with databases, other programming languages, and scientific computing platforms
- **Industry Standard**: Widely used in pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, and healthcare analytics

## What You'll Learn

This course covers the fundamental concepts you need to perform data analysis in cancer research:

1. **R Basics**: Variables, data types, operators, and fundamental programming concepts
2. **Data Structures**: Vectors, matrices, lists, and data frames - the containers for your data
3. **Data Manipulation**: Filtering, transforming, and organizing cancer datasets for analysis
4. **Visualization**: Creating meaningful plots and figures from complex medical data
5. **Statistical Analysis**: Hypothesis testing, correlation, and regression analysis
6. **Advanced Topics**: Unsupervised learning (clustering), supervised machine learning, and survival analysis

## How This Course Is Structured

Each lesson builds upon the previous one, starting with basic syntax and gradually advancing to real-world cancer informatics applications:

- **Foundational Chapters** teach core R concepts and data manipulation skills
- **Applied Chapters** demonstrate these skills using actual cancer datasets (breast cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer)
- **Hands-on Examples** include real code that you can run and experiment with

## Prerequisites

This course assumes you have:
- A computer able to run R and RStudio
- Basic comfort with using a computer and navigating files
- An interest in data analysis and cancer research

**No prior programming experience is required** — we'll start from the very beginning.

## What You'll Be Able to Do

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Load and explore cancer datasets
- Clean and prepare data for analysis
- Create compelling visualizations
- Perform statistical tests relevant to clinical research
- Conduct exploratory data analysis on genomic and clinical data
- Apply machine learning techniques to predict cancer outcomes
- Write reproducible, well-organized analysis scripts

## Getting Started

Each lesson includes:
- **Explanations** of concepts with examples
- **Code samples** you can copy and run
- **Datasets** to practice with (many using real cancer research data)
- **Exercises** to reinforce what you've learned

Take your time with each section. Programming is a skill best learned by doing, so don't just read the code—run it, modify it, and experiment.
