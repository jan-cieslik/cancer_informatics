# Operators

An operator in computer science is usually a symbol or a set of symbols that represent an action. It tells the programme to perform a specific set of instructions or calculations. 


## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform maths operations:


| Operator    | Definition |
|:------:|:-----:|
| + |  Addition |        
| -      |  Subtraction |          
| * | Multiplication |       
|    /  |  Division |          
| %%      | Modulus: returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right | 
|   %/%   | Quotient: returns the quotient by integral division | 
|   ^   | Exponential | 


## Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare two values:

| Operator    | Description |
|:------:|:-----:|
| > |  `TRUE` when first value is greater than second value |        
| <      |  `TRUE` when first value is smaller than second value |       
| <= | `TRUE` when first value is less than or equal to second value |   
|    >=  |  `TRUE` when first value is greater than or equal to second value |        
| ==      | `TRUE` when first value is equal to second value |
|   !=   | `TRUE` when first value is not equal to second value | 


## Logical Operators


| Operator    | Definition | 
|:------:|:-----:|
| &      |  AND operator (element-wise)      |     
|  	 &&  |  AND operator (vector-wise)       |          
| !      | Logical NOT (will return a statement as FALSE, if it is TRUE)                                        |      
|    I   |  OR Operator (element-wise)       |         
| II     | OR operator (vector wise)         |
