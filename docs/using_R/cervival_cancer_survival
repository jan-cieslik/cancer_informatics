# Use Case: Cervical Cancer

This chapter focuses on two different datasets on **cervical cancer**, which we will use to perform different tasks.

## Case 2: Survival Analysis

The second chapter includes a survival analysis of patients with cervical cancer.
We will use the [**cervical cancer dataset (MSK, 2023)**](https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=cervix_msk_2023) from **cBioPortal**, an open source platform for interactive exploration of cancer genomics datasets.

### Getting Started

We will perform a **Kaplan-Meier** survival analysis using the [`survival`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survival) and the [`survminer`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survminer) packages, the latter for better vizualisation. 

```r
# Load the necessary packages
library(survival)
library(survminer)
```

As mentioned earlier, we will use the cervical cancer dataset (MSK, 2023) that I prepared beforehand to simplify the survival analysis.

```r
# Load the dataset
cervsurv <- read.csv("cervical_survival.csv")
```

:::info cervical_survival.csv
- `Patient_ID`
- `Type`: sample type (*primary* or *metastasis*)
- `Time`: overall survival (months)
- `Status`: overall survival status (1 = *deceased*, 0 = *living*)
:::

### Kaplan-Meier Plot

For the survival analysis, we will utilize the **Kaplan-Meier estimate**.
First, we need to create a `Surv` object using the `Surv()` function.

```r
# Create a Surv object
sobj <- Surv(cervsurv$Time, cervsurv$Status)
```

Next on, we will use this `Surv` object to generate survival curves using the `survfit()` function.

```r
# Fit the Kaplan-Meier curves
km <- survfit(sobj ~ 1, data = cervsurv) # "~ 1" will construct a single survival function for all observations
km
```
```r
Call: survfit(formula = sobj ~ 1, data = cervsurv)

   3 observations deleted as missing 
       n events median 0.95LCL 0.95UCL
[1,] 120     62   43.8    30.7      NA
```

Looking at the result of the `survfit()` function, we can see that the median survival of cervical cancer patients in this dataset is 43.8 months.

We will visualize the Kaplan-Meier plot using the `ggsurvplot()` function.
With the `risk.table` argument we can include the *number at risk*.

```r
# Create a Kaplan-Meier plot with number at risk
ggsurvplot(km, risk.table = TRUE, surv.median.line = "hv")
```

This results in the following Kaplan-Meier plot:

### Kaplan-Meier Plot with Covariates

For further analysis, we want to construct different survival curves with covariates.
In this case we will compare the survival curves based on the sample type (*primary* or *metastasis*).

We need to calculate a new Kaplan-Meier estimate using the `survfit()` function and type in the group name (in our case: `Type`) after the tilde (`~`).

```r
# Fit the Kaplan-Meier curves with covariates
km_type <- survfit(sobj ~ Type, data = cervsurv) # "~ Type" will construct multiple survival functions
km_type
```
```r
Call: survfit(formula = sobj ~ Type, data = cervsurv)

   3 observations deleted as missing 
                 n events median 0.95LCL 0.95UCL
Type=Metastasis 47     30   28.8    15.6      46
Type=Primary    73     32   64.6    40.3      NA
```

Here we can see that the median survival for the `Metastasis` group is 28.8 months versus 64.6 months for the `Pimary` group.

We will then visualize the Kaplan-Meier plot again with the `ggsurvplot()` function.
With `pval` set to `TRUE`, we can also include the p-value for log-rank tests into the plot.
This determines whether there are significant differences in survival between the groups.

```r
# Create a Kaplan-Meier plot with number at risk and p-value
ggsurvplot(km_type, data = cervsurv, risk.table = TRUE, surv.median.line = "hv", pval = TRUE)
```

This produces the following survival curves:

![](./Images/cervsurv_type_ggsurvplot.png "Kaplan Meier Plot with Covariates")

From this graph, we can observe that the primary group has a longer median survival time indicating a superior outcome for those patients.
With a p-value of < 0.05, there is a statistically significant difference in survival between patients with primary and metastatic cervical cancer.
