# Installing R and R Studio

Downloading R is an entirely free process. It requires little time and is ready-to-use directly after the installation process. In addition to downloading R, R Studio is a great complement, as it gives you an integrated user interface that works alongside the conventional R interpreter and allows for smooth and hasslefree coding!

## Installing R

1. Go to [The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org).
2. Choose your operating system and click on the corresponding download link:
